  On Monday morning, my father works at the office, my mother stays at home, my little sister goes to school, and I go to university. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and finally Friday, we do the same. But on weekends it is quite different. During the weekend, we are not very busy like other days. On Saturday morning, my very athletic father does swimming, and my mother cooks because every Saturday, my parents invite my aunt to dinner with us. Finally, usually on Sunday we don&#39;t do much; sometimes my father does DIY if necessary.
