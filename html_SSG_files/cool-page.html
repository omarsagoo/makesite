  On Monday mornings, my father works in the office, my mother stays at home, my little sister goes to school, and I go to college. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and finally Friday, we do the same. But on the weekends it is quite different. During the weekend, we are not very busy like other days. On Saturday mornings, my athletic father goes swimming, and my mother cooks because every Saturday my parents invite my aunt to dinner with us. Finally, on Sundays we usually don&#39;t do much; a few times my dad does crafts if necessary.
