## Project Structure

```bash
ðŸ“‚ makesite
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ first-post.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ latest-post.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ makesite.go
â””â”€â”€ template.tmpl
```

## Getting Started

1. Visit [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository named `makesite`.
2. Run each command line-by-line in your terminal to set up the project:

```bash
$ cd ~/go/src
$ git clone git@github.com:Make-School-Labs/makesite.git
$ cd makesite
$ git remote rm origin
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/makesite.git
```

## Deliverables

**For each task**:

- Complete each task in the order they appear.
- Use [GitHub Task List](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists) syntax to update the task list.

### MVP

Complete the MVP as If you finish early, move on to the stretch challenges.

If you get stuck on any step, be sure to print the output to `stdout`!

#### Requirements

- [x] Read in the contents of the provided `first-post.txt` file.
- [x] Edit the provided HTML template (`template.tmpl`) to display the contents of `first-post.txt`.
- [x] Render the contents of `first-post.txt` using Go Templates.
- [x] Write the HTML template to the filesystem to a file. Name it `first-post.html`.
- [x] Manually test the generated HTML page by double-clicking the `first-post.html` and opening it in your browser.
- [x] Add, commit, and push to GitHub.
- [x] Add an argument to your CLI command: the name of any `.txt` file in the same directory as your program. Use `latest-post.txt` to test.
- [x] Update the `save` function to use the input filename to generate a new HTML file. For example, if the input file is named `latest-post.txt`, the generated HTML file should be named `latest-post.html`.
- [x] Add, commit, and push to GitHub.


### v1.1 Requirements
 - [x] Create 3 new .txt files for testing in the same directory as your project.
 - [x] Add a new flag to the makesite command named dir.
 - [x] Use the flag to find all .txt files in the given directory. Print them to stdout.
 - [x] With the list of .txt files you found, generate an HTML page for each.
 - [x] Run ./makesite --dir=. to test in your local directory.
 - [x] Add, commit, and push to GitHub.

 ### v1.2 Requirements
 - [x] Initialize Go modules in your project.
 - [ ] Add any third party library to your project to enhance it's functionality. Some ideas you might consider include (CHOOSE ONLY ONE):
    - [x] Translating page content using Google Translate.
    - [ ] Parse Markdown (.md) files and transform them into HTML. # through ###### should translate to through  elements.
    - [x] I will use the Google Translate library. The documentation is located at https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/apis. My goal is to use it to make sure all the text is in english.
 - [x] Add, commit, and push to GitHub.

#### Stretch Challenges

- [ ] Use Bootstrap, or another CSS framework, to enhance the style and readability of your template. _Get creative! Writing your very own website generator is a great opportunity to broadcast your style, personality, and development preferences to the world!_
- [ ] Recursively find all .txt files in the given directory, as well as it's subdirectories. Print them to stdout to make sure. Generate an HTML page for each.
- [x] When your program finishes, print: Success! Generated 5 pages. The Success! substring must be bold green, and the count (5) must be bold.
- [x] Modify the success message to read: Success! Generated 5 pages (18.2kB total). Calculate the total by summing the size of each HTML file, then converting the total to kilobytes. Always return one significant digit after the decimal point.
- [ ] Determine how long it took to execute your static site generator. Modify the success message to read: Success! Generated 5 pages (18.2kB total) in 3.25 seconds. Always return two significant digits after the decimal point.
- [ ] Test your solutions to these stretch challenges on many different directories containing .txt files. Are there any ways to make your code faster?
